Tacos Locos - ASP.NET Framework MVC Application 

Programmer - Montgomery Day

This challenge was started on 1/15/2022 and finished on 1/16/2022. Very fun and was a little bit challenging at times (mainly the time-crunch). You should be able to easily launch this from Visual Studio and test my code (spoiler it works)

What you will need
	
	1. Windows 10
	2. Visual Studio
	3. IIS Express

Extracting the Zip File. 

	1. Create a folder in File Explorer and label is 'TacosLocos'
	2. Navigate to where you downloaded the Zip file "TacosLocos-main"
	3. Right click and select, 'Extract All'
	4. Select the folder that you created in step 1. 
	5. Wait for file to finish extracting and you are done with Step 1. 

Launching Website Locally. 

	The best way to launch this website is to open it in Visual Studio and Launch IIS Express (Green Arrow at the Top). If this is not an option then you will need to Host the website locally from the command line.
