Tacos Locos - ASP.NET Framework MVC Application 

Programmer - Montgomery Day

This challenge was started on 1/15/2022 and finished on 1/16/2022. This represents roughly 6 to 8 total hours of my life (mainly on 1/15). Very fun and was a little bit challenging at times (mainly the time-crunch aspect). You should be able to easily launch this from Visual Studio and test my code (spoiler it works). It felt wrong to not include Unit Tests despite tham not being a part of the challenge. They were helpful when I was debugging some the logic and I feel strongly that writing tests is a part of development itself. 

The second biggest challenge of this project was shoe-horning in the use of JSONs. I wanted to show off my knowledge of them but also leave it in such a way that we could easily scale the project up if we wanted to and connect it to other projects. 

One last comment that I feel I need to add is that I did not follow my normal protocol with commits. I wrote this entire program in one go and then commited the whole thing which is not how I normally work. I only do that when I'm do one-off projects that I plan to push to GitHub(like this one). 

Happy coding!
